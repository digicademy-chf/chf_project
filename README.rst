===========
CHF Project
===========

This is a boilerplate sitepackage for the Cultural Heritage Framework (CHF).
It contains examples of configuration, overrides, and custom assets to
orchestrate components of the CHF, including optional components like
generic APIs, visualisations, and quality assurance. The goal is to
implement relatively conservative server infrastructure that is easy to
maintain. This is combined with frontend flourishes that academic and
non-academic users come to expect without building a JavaScript client.
